# Keti SVG repository

This repository functions as source for the Keti art pipeline.

After preprocessing each SVG part is converted into a template,
to be used for visualization of the look of newly fused chips,
as interpreted from their immutable attrributes on the blockchain!

The `parts.yml` structures the SVG sources, and provides additional data such as color options.
